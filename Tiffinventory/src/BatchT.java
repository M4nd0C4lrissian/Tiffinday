//Gonna be a bitch to always treat case and jar as separate and specified entities if we wish to generalize. Should do something similar to my OG CaseT and JarT, but with just enums, and their associated values 
//--Note, associated values wouldn't work because they need to be dynamic, but it could work with database, initialized by user, to create a "relatively final" array (arraylist most likely) of strings associated to indices that can be used as reference (so when they click on the screen to 
// to choose the specific product, that will be associated with the respective indice as well), and we can pass in an array of [0,2,3,1,8, ... , 1] lets say, and that would override the values for all N types of sizes / packaging methods associated with those indices, and another boolean array or just arraylist of ints could be passed to indicate where and where not to apply the function)
